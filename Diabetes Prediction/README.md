# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction & Analytics Dashboard

An interactive **Diabetes Prediction and Analytics Dashboard** built using Machine Learning and deployed as a static web application using **Netlify**.

The project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a patient is likely to be diabetic based on clinical parameters such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, insulin level, and other health-related features.

## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a common health condition that can be influenced by several clinical and lifestyle factors. This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to analyze diabetes-related data and provide a prediction based on patient health parameters.

The original project was developed as an interactive Streamlit dashboard using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The Netlify version converts the dashboard into a **static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application**, allowing it to run directly in a web browser without requiring a Python server.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict diabetes risk using Machine Learning.
* Analyze important diabetes-related health parameters.
* Provide an interactive prediction interface.
* Visualize the dataset using an EDA dashboard.
* Evaluate Decision Tree model performance.
* Deploy the application as a static website using Netlify.
* Create a user-friendly and responsive dashboard.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

### Decision Tree Classifier

The project uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** with the following configuration:

```python
DecisionTreeClassifier(
    criterion="gini",
    random_state=42
)
```

The dataset is divided into:

* **80% Training Data**
* **20% Testing Data**

The model is trained using the following input features:

| Feature                  | Description                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Pregnancies              | Number of pregnancies        |
| Glucose                  | Plasma glucose concentration |
| BloodPressure            | Blood pressure measurement   |
| SkinThickness            | Skin fold thickness          |
| Insulin                  | Insulin level                |
| BMI                      | Body Mass Index              |
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Diabetes pedigree function   |
| Age                      | Patient age                  |

### Model Result

**Test Accuracy: approximately 74.68%**

> Accuracy can vary if the dataset or training configuration is changed.

The main Netlify deployment uses:

```text
index.html
```

The prediction logic is embedded directly into JavaScript, so the static deployment does not require:

```text
app.py
Python
Streamlit
Flask
```

## 🌐 Netlify Deployment

The project is designed for simple static deployment.

### Step 1 — Clone Repository

```bash
https://github.com/darshanbhor2006/Machine-Learning-Projects/new/main/Diabetes%20Prediction
```

### Step 2 — Open Project

```bash
cd Diabetes-Prediction
```

### Step 3 — Deploy

Upload the project folder to Netlify using **Deploy manually**, or connect the GitHub repository to Netlify.

Since the project contains a static `index.html`, no build command is required.

### Netlify Settings

```text
Build command: None
Publish directory: .
```

## 💡 Why Static Deployment?

The original application uses Streamlit and Python. However, Netlify is primarily suitable for static websites and frontend applications.

Therefore, this version embeds the Decision Tree prediction logic into JavaScript.

This allows the application to run completely inside the user's browser.
