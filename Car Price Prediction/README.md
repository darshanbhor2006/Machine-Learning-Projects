# 🚗 Automobile Price Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Automobile Price Prediction System** is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the estimated price of an automobile based on its specifications.

The project uses a **Random Forest Regression** algorithm trained on an Automobile dataset. The trained model is saved as a pickle file and integrated with a **Streamlit** web application for easy and interactive price prediction.

Users can enter automobile specifications such as engine size, horsepower, curb weight, mileage, dimensions, and other features to obtain an estimated automobile price.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

The project uses:

### Random Forest Regression

`RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)`

Random Forest Regression combines multiple decision trees to produce a more reliable prediction for continuous numerical values.

The model is trained using automobile specifications and predicts:

**Target Variable: `price`**

## 📊 Features Used

The trained model uses the following automobile features:

| Feature             | Description                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `symboling`         | Automobile risk/symbol rating |
| `wheel-base`        | Wheelbase of the automobile   |
| `length`            | Overall automobile length     |
| `width`             | Overall automobile width      |
| `height`            | Overall automobile height     |
| `curb-weight`       | Weight of the automobile      |
| `num-of-cylinders`  | Number of engine cylinders    |
| `engine-size`       | Engine size                   |
| `compression-ratio` | Engine compression ratio      |
| `horsepower`        | Engine horsepower             |
| `peak-rpm`          | Maximum engine RPM            |
| `city-mpg`          | Mileage in city driving       |
| `highway-mpg`       | Mileage on highway            |

## 📈 Model Performance

The Random Forest Regression model produced the following results in the Jupyter Notebook:

### Test Data

* **Mean Squared Error:** 5,030,141.00
* **Root Mean Squared Error:** 2,242.80
* **Mean Absolute Error:** 1,508.43
* **R² Score:** **0.9355**

### Training Data

* **Mean Squared Error:** 1,532,868.89
* **Root Mean Squared Error:** 1,238.09
* **Mean Absolute Error:** 683.84
* **R² Score:** **0.9733**

The test R² score of approximately **93.55%** indicates that the model explains a large portion of the variation in automobile prices.

## 📓 Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook contains the complete Machine Learning workflow:

1. Import required libraries
2. Load the Automobile dataset
3. Explore the dataset
4. Perform data preprocessing
5. Select input and target variables
6. Split data into training and testing sets
7. Train regression models
8. Evaluate model performance
9. Select Random Forest Regression
10. Save the trained model using Pickle

---

## 💾 Model Saving

After training the Random Forest model, the model is saved using Pickle.

```python
import pickle

with open("auto_price_model.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(rf_reg, file)

with open("feature_columns.pkl", "wb") as file:
    pickle.dump(list(X.columns), file)
```

This generates:

```text
auto_price_model.pkl
feature_columns.pkl
```

## 🌐 Streamlit Web Application

The Streamlit application provides an interactive interface where users can enter automobile specifications.

### User Inputs

* Symboling
* Wheel Base
* Length
* Width
* Height
* Curb Weight
* Number of Cylinders
* Engine Size
* Compression Ratio
* Horsepower
* Peak RPM
* City MPG
* Highway MPG

After entering the values, the user clicks:

```text
🚀 Predict Automobile Price
```

The application then displays the predicted automobile price.

Example:

```text
💰 Predicted Automobile Price

$9,580.95
```

The displayed value is generated dynamically by the trained Machine Learning model.
